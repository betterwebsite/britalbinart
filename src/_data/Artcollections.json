      "description": "It began with a painting I created for a friend who was walking through a very painful divorce. After over a year of separation and ongoing legal battles, he asked me to create something for his soon-to-be ex-wife, a gift of encouragement, a symbol of hope. The painting was meant to remind them both that no matter the hurt of the past or the unknown future, God can redeem what feels broken beyond repair. Three months after receiving their painting and, after both friends surrendered their brokenness to Jesus, I received a text message I'll never forget: \"Your painting is in hanging in the center of OUR home.\" God restored their marriage! The painting now hangs in their living room with their initials on each side and has become a symbol of the restoration God brought to their family. What a God of restoration we serve!!!",

      "description": "“Without brokenness there is no need for grace. Without grace, there is only brokenness.” - Brit Albin Art\n\nThe Mended Series is based on the Japanese philosophy of Kintsugi - The art of mending something broken with gold. They say because something is broken, it has a story, and that story makes it beautiful. Our faith is often tried in seasons of brokenness but God says through sufficient trial, we will come forth as precious and as pure as gold. Refinement is necessary. (Job 23:10) \n\nEach Mended painting is a sweet reminder that God’s grace still mends, brings hope to, and transform broken places.\n\nGive him all your “broken” and with it, he will make a masterpiece. \n\n"
